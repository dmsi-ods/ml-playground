# Data Visualization
## Description
Inspired with the assignment from MIPT machine learning course.

Data visualization is the first step in solving virtually any data analysis task, in particular, when participating in a competition. Visualization helps to decide which data preprocessing should be carried out, which methods are best, and which features to add. In this notebook, we will work with this [kaggle-competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prudential-life-insurance-assessment), which ended in the winter of 2016. 

__Competition task:__ using person characteristics and his application for medical insurance to predict the degree of risk of this insurance.

__What are we going to do:__
* view data;
* try some data visualization methods;
* analyze graphs and try to draw conclusions that are useful for the next stages of solving the problem.
